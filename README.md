This personal project of mine is to create a native app that will host a localized browser source for Twitch streamers to not have to rely on 3rd party providers.

Finally decided to make a repository for this. There are two versions where one is a Python backend and a JavaScript backend. Planning to make a C# version as well as i'm trying to figure out a good UI framework to build with. For right now, a lot of my time is being spent on my capstone project for school, but will pick this back up soon as there has been a lot of interest in this application and I would like for it to come to life!
