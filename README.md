
# Localized Twitch Overlay Project

This personal project of mine is to create a native app that will host a localized browser source for Twitch streamers to not have to rely on 3rd party providers.

# GOALS:
- ~Successfully make a repository~
- Decide on backend language and UI framework
- Make streamlined onboarding process 
- Make simple HTML alert for streams 
- Add an import feature to allow custom files 
- [Very ambitious] Make a live edit feature to edit overlays
- More to come!
# How to use and setup.

[WILL GET BACK TO THIS. CAPSTONE PROJECT HAS PRIORITY]

# Updates: 
[04/05/2025] \
Finally decided to make a repository for this. There are two versions where one is a Python backend and a JavaScript backend. Planning to make a C# version as well as i'm trying to figure out a good UI framework to build with. For right now, a lot of my time is being spent on my capstone project for school (WILL MAKE A REPO FOR THAT PROJECT SOON, WILL BE UPLOADED THIS BECAUSE OF DEV CUTOFF DAY THIS WEEK), but will pick this back up soon as there has been a lot of interest in this application and I would like for it to come to life!
